IMPORTANT INFO

THIS MOD IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH LAZYBONES' NEW TRANSFORMATIONS MOD. PLEASE UNINSTALL HIS MOD BEFORE USING THIS ONE, AND VICE VERSA. As of now, no compatibility patch for the two is planned.

Use ZSoulTool to allow UI Goku to use his Super-Soul. Make sure to import the zss into slot 171, otherwise Goku will not use the Super-Soul.

To install the Super Soul properly, load up the required files (check the top-left of the window to know which files to load), change the id to 171, select ZSoul from the top bar of the window, and select Import/Replace. This will get the super soul working.
 
UI Goku's Super-Soul, ..., activates a 45-second long Auto-Dodge after using the skill, Sacred Heat. After which, the skill will be useless, as it cannot activate the effect more than once a round.
